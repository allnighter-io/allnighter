# Challenge this decision before I commit

Session-led blind jury (Spec Review team). Spec Review is the common recipe — you synthesize; seats return structured findings only.

## Example utterances

1. "Challenge this decision before I commit."
2. "Run Spec Review on this doc — I want a second opinion."
3. "Blind-jury this architecture call before we build."

## Recipe

Ask the menu first:

```bash
alln menu --json
```

Run Spec Review on the target (fill `--project`; pass the doc path or its content
in the prompt). Runs are foreground — the verdict comes back in this terminal:

```bash
alln run --team code_spec_review --project <id|path> --json "<path to the doc, or its content>"
```

Read a settled run again by id:

```bash
alln show <run-id> --json
```

Optional chain into a loop on the same doc once the run settles:

```bash
alln loop start "<what you want done>" --spec <same-path> --pm caller --project <id|path> --json
```
